# Dynamsoft Barcode Reader Documentation for C++ Edition

Dynamsoft Barcode Reader (DBR) SDK C++ Edition is a barcode reading tool designed specifically for C++ developers.

Leveraging the efficiency and flexibility of the C++ language, DBR C++ Edition provides rich APIs for developers to easily integrate barcode reading functionality into your c++ applications. Please take a look at [API Reference]({{site.dbr_cpp_api}}index.html) to see details.

In addition, DBR C++ Edition provides cross-platform support, running on multiple operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and Mac, to meet the needs of different development environments

As one of the functional products of the Dynamsoft Capture Vision (DCV) framework, DBR is also designed to seamlessly integrate with other DCV components and provide developers with a comprehensive set of image processing tools, which cover image capturing, content understanding, result parsing, and interactive workflow. If you are building such a capturing and processing solution, take a look at [Introduction to Dynamsoft Capture Vision]({{site.dcvb_architecture}}).

Furthermore, DBR provides a powerful parameter system in order to cope with various scenarios. Read <a href="{{site.dbr_parameters_reference}}index.html">Parameter Reference</a> for details.
