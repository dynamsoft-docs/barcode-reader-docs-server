## 11.2.1000 (10/14/2025)

### 🎉Milestone Release
Version 11.2.1000 introduces a series of AI-driven improvements designed to enhance barcode detection accuracy, processing speed, and configuration flexibility.

This release focuses on practical performance gains for production environments across retail, logistics, and manufacturing workflows.

### ✨ Key Highlights
#### AI-Powered Barcode Detection and Decoding

- New Localization Models – Introduces [`OneDLocalization`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/localization-modes.html#modelnamearray) and [`DataMatrixQRCodeLocalization`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/localization-modes.html#modelnamearray) neural network models for improved detection of **blurred / low-resolution 1D codes**, or **partially damaged DataMatrix/QR codes**.
- Specialized Decoders – Adds [`EAN13Decoder`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/deblur-modes.html#modelnamearray) and [`Code128Decoder`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/deblur-modes.html#modelnamearray) models optimized for **long-distance** and **motion-blurred** decoding scenarios.
- Redesigned Deblur Model – The [`OneDDeblur`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/deblur-modes.html#modelnamearray) model now provides more effective recovery from **motion and focus blur**.
- Configurable Model Selection – The new `ModelNameArray` parameter supports flexible model loading and fine-grained control for specific barcode types.

#### Precision and Processing Control

- Enhanced Deblur Methods – [`DM_DEEP_ANALYSIS`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/deblur-modes.html#dm_deep_analysis) now includes sub-level control with `OneDGeneral`, `TwoDGeneral`, and `EAN13Enhanced` options.
- Barcode Count Expectation – The new [`ExpectedBarcodesCount`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-format-specification/expected-barcodes-count.html) parameter enables **format-specific quantity control** and **early termination** in fixed-count workflows.
- Improved Region Detection – The new [`RPM_GRAY_CONSISTENCY`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}image-parameter/region-predetection-modes.html#rpm_gray_consistency) mode provides more precise region extraction based on **grayscale uniformity** and **local consistency** for document and label processing.

### Performance Highlights

#### Barcode Workflows

- Up to **26.5%** higher read rates under blur conditions with as much as **44%** faster processing.
- Reliable decoding of DataMatrix and QR codes with missing or damaged finder patterns.
- Extended operational range beyond 75 cm for long-distance barcode scanning.

### Developer Notes

- Backward Compatibility – Fully compatible with existing integrations; no code-level changes required for upgrade.
- Configuration Flexibility – Expanded parameter set allows comprehensive model configuration for scenario-specific tuning.
- Production Stability – All new models validated in enterprise environments.

### Changed

#### Parameter Defaults

- [`MaxThreadsInOneTask`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/max-threads-in-one-task.html): default changed from 4 → 0 (auto-detection).
- [`IncludeTrailingCheckDigit`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-format-specification/include-trailing-check-digit.html): default changed from 1 → 0. Code128 results will no longer include the trailing check digit by default for improved compliance with standard decoding practices.

### Deprecations

- `DeblurModelNameArray` argument of [`DeblurModes`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/deblur-modes.html) → use `ModelNameArray`.
- `append_model_buffer` method of `CaptureVisionRouter` → use [`append_dl_model_buffer`]({{ site.dcvb_python_api }}capture-vision-router/auxiliary-methods.html#append_dl_model_buffer).

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where accessing `Quadrilateral.points` directly would return random values instead of the expected coordinate points.

## 11.0.6000 (08/06/2025)

### Changed

- `start_capturing` now stops immediately and returns a license-related error code if none of the tasks have a valid license, instead of proceeding and returning an empty result.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug that caused a crash when using a specific type of license.
- Fixed various minor bugs and improved overall stability.

## 11.0.4000 (07/15/2025)

### New

- **Tile-Based TIFF Image Support**: Added support for TIFF images with tile-based storage format.

- **Template Version Validation**: Introduced version checking for templates to prevent compatibility issues and mismatches.

### Changed

- **License Validation Behavior**: Instead of stopping execution immediately on an invalid license module, the library now continues processing and returns results from modules with valid licenses. An error is still reported to indicate the license issue.

- **PDFR License Control Removal**: Removed the license check for the PDFR module.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the `get_detected_quad_result_items` method of `ProcessedDocumentResult` returned items of the wrong type.
- Fixed various minor bugs and improved overall stability.

## 11.0.3000 (05/15/2025)

### New

- Added support for appending pages to PDF files generated by `ImageIO.save_to_file`. Appending to other PDF files is not supported.
- Added new property [codewords]({{ site.dbr_python_api }}pdf417-details.html#codewords) to the `PDF417Details` class.
 
### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where calling `start_capturing` or `capture` with `template_name` set to an empty string ("") would result in error `-40103`.
- Resolved a performance issue that could cause unusually high CPU and memory usage in some cases.

### Changed

- Removed the licensing requirement for saving PDFs.


## 11.0.2000 (04/09/2025)
