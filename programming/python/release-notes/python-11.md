# Release Notes for Python Edition - 11.x

## 11.0.6000 (08/06/2025)

### Changed

- `start_capturing` now stops immediately and returns a license-related error code if none of the tasks have a valid license, instead of proceeding and returning an empty result.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug that caused a crash when using a specific type of license.
- Fixed various minor bugs and improved overall stability.

## 11.0.4000 (07/15/2025)

### New

- **Tile-Based TIFF Image Support**: Added support for TIFF images with tile-based storage format.

- **Template Version Validation**: Introduced version checking for templates to prevent compatibility issues and mismatches.

### Changed

- **License Validation Behavior**: Instead of stopping execution immediately on an invalid license module, the library now continues processing and returns results from modules with valid licenses. An error is still reported to indicate the license issue.

- **PDFR License Control Removal**: Removed the license check for the PDFR module.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where the `get_detected_quad_result_items` method of `ProcessedDocumentResult` returned items of the wrong type.
- Fixed various minor bugs and improved overall stability.

## 11.0.3000 (05/15/2025)

### New

- Added support for appending pages to PDF files generated by `ImageIO.save_to_file`. Appending to other PDF files is not supported.
- Added new property [codewords]({{ site.dbr_python_api }}pdf417-details.html#codewords) to the `PDF417Details` class.
 
### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where calling `start_capturing` or `capture` with `template_name` set to an empty string ("") would result in error `-40103`.
- Resolved a performance issue that could cause unusually high CPU and memory usage in some cases.

### Changed

- Removed the licensing requirement for saving PDFs.


## 11.0.2000 (04/09/2025)

### [Highlights](https://www.dynamsoft.com/release-highlights/?product=dbr11.0)

- Workflow Improvements
  - Restructured the parameter control hierarchy at all levels for finer scope definition and more granular process management, with the stage level newly added.
  - Enabled custom combinations and sequences of sections, increasing flexibility and operational customization under specific conditions.

- Deep Learning Integration
  - Improved the reading rate of 1D barcode by introducing a new deblurring deep-learning model.

- Algorithm Enhancements
  - Enabled deduplication at the Region of Interest (ROI) level to consolidate results from multiple tasks.
  - Improved the **CODE_128** and **DataMatrix** DeepAnalysis algorithms for better decoding accuracy and performance.
  - Added support for new barcode types: **CODE_32**, **MATRIX_25**, **KIX**, and **TELEPEN**.

- Engineering Optimizations
  - Unified template-loading logic to reduce I/O overhead.
  - Added support for capturing data from multi-page files, including **PDF** and **TIFF** formats.
  - Implemented conversion functionality between `ImageData` and image files, including both on-disk and in-memory files.
