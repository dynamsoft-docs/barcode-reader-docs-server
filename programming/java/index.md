# Introduction to Dynamsoft Barcode Reader Java Edition

Dynamsoft Barcode Reader (DBR) SDK Java Edition is a barcode reading tool designed specifically for java developers.

Leveraging the efficiency and flexibility of the java language, DBR Java Edition provides rich APIs for developers to easily integrate barcode reading functionality into your java applications. Please take a look at [API Reference]({{ site.dbr_java_api }}) to see details.

As one of the functional products of the Dynamsoft Capture Vision (DCV) framework, DBR is also designed to seamlessly integrate with other DCV components and provide developers with a comprehensive set of image processing tools, which cover image capturing, content understanding, result parsing, and interactive workflow. If you are building such a capturing and processing solution, take a look at [Introduction to Dynamsoft Capture Vision]({{ site.dcvb_architecture }}).

Furthermore, DBR provides a powerful parameter system in order to cope with various scenarios. Read [Parameters]({{ site.dbr_parameters }}structure-and-interfaces-of-parameters.html) for details.
