# Release Notes for Java Edition - 11.x

## 11.2.1000 (10/14/2025)

üéâ **Milestone Release** - This version introduces groundbreaking AI-powered enhancements that significantly improve accuracy and performance across various barcode processing scenarios.

### ‚ú® Key Highlights

**AI-Powered Barcode Detection & Decoding**
- üß† **First-to-Market AI Localization**: Revolutionary `OneDLocalization` and `DataMatrixQRCodeLocalization` neural network models for superior detection of **blurred/low-resolution 1D codes** and **DataMatrix/QR codes with missing or damaged finder patterns**
- ‚ö° **Specialized Decoders**: Cutting-edge `EAN13Decoder` and `Code128Decoder` models deliver unprecedented accuracy for **blurred and long-distance** scenarios
- üîç **Enhanced Clarity Processing**: Completely redesigned `OneDDeblur` model with superior **motion blur and focus blur** recovery algorithms
- üéØ **Flexible Model Configuration**: Advanced `ModelNameArray` parameter enables on-demand model loading and precise selection for specific barcode scenarios

**Precision Control**
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Granular Deblur Methods**: Fine-tuned `DM_DEEP_ANALYSIS` with specialized method control - `OneDGeneral`, `TwoDGeneral`, and `EAN13Enhanced` for targeted optimization
- üéØ **Smart Barcode Counting**: New `ExpectedBarcodesCount` parameter enables **format-specific quantity control** and **early termination optimization** for known-quantity scenarios
- üîç **Advanced Region Detection**: New `RPM_GRAY_CONSISTENCY` mode enables precise region detection based on **grayscale uniformity** and **local consistency** for document and label processing


### üí° What This Means for You

**For Challenging Barcode Scenarios**
- **Blurred conditions**: 26.5% better read rates with 44% faster processing - ideal for handheld scanning and moving objects
- **Extended distance capability**: Breakthrough support for reading distances beyond 75cm - revolutionizing warehouse automation and high-shelf scanning
- **Damaged 2D codes**: Enhanced detection of DataMatrix and QR codes with missing or damaged finder patterns - perfect for manufacturing and logistics applications

**For Enterprise Integration**
- **Retail environments**: Enhanced performance for blurred handheld scanning and long-distance shelf reading
- **Logistics & shipping**: Improved recognition for package tracking with better blur and long-distance scanning capabilities
- **Manufacturing QC**: Improved 2D code reading on printed/etched parts with wear damage

**For Developers**
- **Backward Compatible**: Seamless upgrade with existing code and easy migration path
- **Flexible Configuration**: Extensive parameter customization for specific use cases and comprehensive model configuration options
- **Enterprise Ready**: Battle-tested stability for production environments

### Changed

- Updated the default value of parameter [`MaxThreadsInOneTask`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/max-threads-in-one-task.html) from 4 to 0 (auto-detection).
- Updated the default value of parameter [`IncludeTrailingCheckDigit`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-format-specification/include-trailing-check-digit.html) from 1 to 0.
- Deprecated argument `DeblurModelNameArray` of parameter [`DeblurModes`]({{ site.dcvb_parameters_reference }}barcode-reader-task-settings/deblur-modes.html), use `ModelNameArray` instead.
- Deprecated method `appendModelBuffer` of class [`CaptureVisionRouter`]({{ site.dcvb_java_api }}capture-vision-router/capture-vision-router.html), use [`appendDLModelBuffer`]({{ site.dcvb_java_api }}capture-vision-router/auxiliary-methods.html#appenddlmodelbuffer) instead.

## 11.0.6100 (08/19/2025)

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where using a callback function could cause the program to crash.


## 11.0.6000 (08/06/2025)

### [Highlights](https://www.dynamsoft.com/release-highlights/?product=dbr11.0)

- Workflow Improvements
  - Restructured the parameter control hierarchy at all levels for finer scope definition and more granular process management, with the stage level newly added.
  - Enabled custom combinations and sequences of sections, increasing flexibility and operational customization under specific conditions.

- Deep Learning Integration
  - Improved the reading rate of 1D barcode by introducing a new deblurring deep-learning model.

- Algorithm Enhancements
  - Enabled deduplication at the Region of Interest (ROI) level to consolidate results from multiple tasks.
  - Improved the **CODE_128** and **DataMatrix** DeepAnalysis algorithms for better decoding accuracy and performance.
  - Added support for new barcode types: **CODE_32**, **MATRIX_25**, **KIX**, and **TELEPEN**.

- Engineering Optimizations
  - Unified template-loading logic to reduce I/O overhead.
  - Added support for capturing data from multi-page files, including **PDF** and **TIFF** formats.
  - Implemented conversion functionality between `ImageData` and image files, including both on-disk and in-memory files.
